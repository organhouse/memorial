                    Organ House was a Bay Area community devoted to normalizing non-monogamy and sexual exploration. We
                    organized
                    public & private events for the growing non-monogamous community from 2014 to March of 2020. We are
                    proud of
                    fostering a strong culture of consent that made headlines. We canceled all in-person events
                    indefinitely on
                    March 7 of 2020, due to the Coronavirus pandemic.

                    Kate was a Co-Founder and the CEO of Organ House. While the success of Organ House depended on many
                    committed,
                    wonderful individuals, Kate's impact was irreplaceable. She will be forever missed and loved by
                    many.
